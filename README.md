### What I learned

I used Tailwind CSS for this project alongside with ReactJS library. it was fun working with Tailwind CSS but it took a lot of my time. I don't know why, but I still prefer Vanilla CSS for my projects. Maybe with time and practice, I will get used to it.

Also, I will add some other functionalities to this project soon. Hopefully, I will update my solution as soon as I get my desired results.
I'm looking forward to your advice. I would appreciate any feedback.

Thank you, Frontend Mentor, and the community for everything I've learned during these couple of months.

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->



### Continued development

Also, I will add some other functionalities to this project soon. Hopefully, I will update my solution as soon as I get my desired results.
